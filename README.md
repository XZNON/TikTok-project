# TikTok Claims Classification Project

## **Project Overview**
At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our platform enables users to submit reports identifying videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports help moderators review content, but the large volume of reports makes timely evaluation challenging. 

To improve efficiency, TikTok is developing a predictive model that can classify whether a video contains a claim or an opinion. This model will help prioritize user reports and reduce backlog, enhancing content moderation processes.

## **Project Scope**
The TikTok data team is nearing the completion of the claims classification project. The remaining tasks include:
1. **Model Building** – Develop and fine-tune a predictive machine learning model.
2. **Model Evaluation** – Assess the model's accuracy, performance, and effectiveness.
3. **Findings Summary** – Present key insights and results to cross-departmental stakeholders.

## **Responsibilities**
As part of the final phase of the project, you will be responsible for:
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming relevant features for model input.
- **Model Development**: Implementing and training a classification model using appropriate machine learning techniques.
- **Evaluation & Optimization**: Testing and refining the model to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Reporting & Documentation**: Summarizing findings in a clear and concise format for cross-functional teams.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Models to be tested**: XGBoost, Random Forest
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Processing**: NLP techniques, Feature Selection, Preprocessing Pipelines
- **Model Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## **Expected Outcome**
The goal of this project is to deploy a well-performing predictive model that assists TikTok's moderation team in efficiently handling user reports. The final model should be able to accurately distinguish between claims and opinions, improving content review prioritization.

## **Next Steps**
- Implement feature engineering techniques to enhance model input.
- Train and optimize the classification model.
- Conduct rigorous model evaluation to measure performance.
- Document and present findings to stakeholders.
